About CommView
==============

CommView is a program for monitoring Internet and Local Area Network
(LAN) activity capable of capturing and analyzing network packets.
It gathers information about data passing through your dial-up
connection or Ethernet card and decodes the analyzed data.

With CommView you can see the list of network connections and vital
IP statistics and examine individual packets. Packets are decoded
down to the lowest layer with full analysis of the most widespread
protocols. Full access to raw data is also provided. Captured
packets can be saved to log files for future analysis. A flexible
system of filters makes it possible to drop packets you don't need
or capture only those packets that you wish to capture.

CommView is a helpful tool for LAN administrators, security
professionals, network programmers, or anyone who wants to have
a full picture of the traffic going through one's PC or LAN segment.
